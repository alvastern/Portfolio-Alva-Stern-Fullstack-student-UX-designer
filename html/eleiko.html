                <p>In this project, me and my project group collaborated with Eleiko, where the task was to 
                    design a service where Eleikos customers would be able to rent training equipment and provide 
                    Eleiko with knowledge about how the equipment is being used. The goal 
                    was also to explore the opportunities for a circular business model for Eleiko, where they 
                    wanted to go from a linear to circular business model and be able to control the circularity 
                    of their equipment.</p>

                <p class="insights"><b>Design isn’t always about details:</b> I learned that design could be about designing concepts 
                    and services instead of just detailed interfaces.</p>

                <p class="insights"><b>Design for the project owner:</b> I learned that I have to adapt my design decisions and 
                    solutions based on what the project owner wants.</p>

                <p class="insights"><b>Conversations:</b> Service design is about creating value, therefore it’s 
                    better to have conversations rather that interviews with the stakeholders.</p>

                <p class="insights"><b>Adapt design process:</b> I learned that the design process needs to be adapted to the project.</p>

                <p class="insights"><b>Data from interviews:</b> I learned that it’s essential to define the data to be gathered 
                    before interviews.</p>

                <p class="insights"><b>Preparatory work & domain knowledge:</b> I realized preparatory work and domain knowledge are 
                    important aspects to set limits to the project.</p>
